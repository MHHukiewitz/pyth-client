test initialize for:
1. Check that first entry is invalid

test add_price() for SMA tracker:
A-Paritition on entry_of(prev_time), entry_of(current_time):
1. Same entry
2. Consecutive Entries
3. Skips a small number of entries (less than NumEntries)
4. skips an extrememly large number of entries

B-Paritition on prev_time - current_time:
1. Less than Threshold, greater than Threshold

C - Check that num valid entries is correct with all the combinations above

D- Check that max absolute value is correct even with all the above
E- check correct validity

Taking the product of all these combinations, we get 8 tests from A and B, plus a check at the end of each test

test add_price for Tick Tracker:

A (same as above)

B time_from_current_entry_to_next_entry:
less than threshohold, greater than threshold

C check correct validity

Taking the product of all these combinations, we get 8 tests from A and B, plus a check at the end of each test
